## Why Reproducibility Matters

**Science builds on itself:**
- Verification of findings
- Error detection and correction
- Learning from previous work
- Cumulative knowledge advancement

**Without reproducibility → No science**

::: {.notes}
Reproducibility is not an add-on feature but the core mechanism that makes science self-correcting

## The Reproducibility Problem

**Current reality in research:**
- Core elements remain unpublished (data, code, materials)
- Published articles alone cannot enable reproduction
- Meta-scientific studies show low reproducibility rates
- This fundamentally undermines cumulative science

---

## What is Reproducibility?

**Key distinction:**

|  | Same Data | Different Data |
|---|---|---|
| **Same Analysis** | **Reproducible** | Replicable |
| **Different Analysis** | Robust | Generalizable |

**Today's focus:** Making our work reproducible

---

## Two Interconnected Practices

1. **Reproducible Reporting**
   - Document the complete analytical workflow
   - Make every step traceable and executable

2. **FAIR Data Management**
   - Ensure research products can be found and reused
   - Systematic framework for long-term accessibility

---

## Reproducibility as Core Practice

**Not an optional extra, but:**
- Enables scientific verification
- Facilitates error detection
- Allows learning from publications
- Strengthens cumulative knowledge

**Question:** How do we make this practical?

# Reproducible Reporting

---

## The Current Problem

Example: "A confirmatory factor analysis provided evidence for the proposed two-dimensional structure (CFI = .956, TLI = .955, SRMR = .047)"

**Can you reproduce this?**
- Which measurement model?
- Which estimator?
- How were missing values handled?
- Where is the data?

**→ Impossible without code and data**

---

## Evidence: Reproducibility is Rare

**Empirical studies show low reproducibility:**

> **Add studies from repo comp-repro!!!**

- **Psychology** (Hardwicke et al. 2018, 2021): Difficulties reproducing published analyses even with open data
- **Economics** (Chang & Li 2015): Problems reproducing results from published papers
- **Political Science** (Eubank 2016): Challenges in replication attempts

**Common barriers:** Missing code, incomplete data documentation, unclear analytical steps

---

## The Solution: Add Code and Data

**Peng (2011):** Publication becomes reproducible when researchers provide:
1. The data used
2. The analysis code

**But this alone is often not enough...**

---

## Beyond Code and Data

**Remaining challenges:**

- Which code file on which data in which order?
- Software version differences
- Operating system dependencies
- Package version conflicts

**Educational research:** Often multi-step procedures with various software packages

---

## The Reproducibility Spectrum

```
Not reproducible ←―――――――――――――→ Gold standard
```

1. Publication only
2. Publication + Code
3. Publication + Code and Data
4. Linked, executable code and data
5. Isolated computational environment (Docker, Binder, Quarto-live)

---

## Literate Programming: The Key

**Concept by Knuth (1984):**
- Interweaving natural language and code
- Human-readable documentation
- Code, output, and narrative in one document

**Modern implementation:**
- Quarto
- R Markdown
- Jupyter Notebooks

---

## Example: Quarto Document

**Left side:** Markdown + Code blocks  
**Right side:** Rendered document

- Direct traceability from text to computation
- Every coefficient traceable to its calculation
- Automatic documentation of analytical decisions
- Output in .docx, .pdf, .html, and more

---

## Benefits of Reproducible Reporting

**For science:**
- Error detection by reviewers and readers
- Learning from methodological details
- Building on previous work

**For you:**
- Better organized workflow
- Easier to revise analyses
- Documented decisions for future reference
- Facilitates collaboration

---

## Computational Reproducibility

**Problem:** Different software versions, operating systems

**Solutions:**

1. **Basic:** Provide code + data + session info
2. **Better:** Use package management (renv, conda)
3. **Best:** Containerization (Docker) or web-based execution (Quarto-live)

---

## Quarto-Live: Full Reproducibility

**Three lines of code change:**

```yaml
format: live-html
engine: knitr
```

**Result:**
- Completely isolated computational environment
- Accessible via browser
- Executable via WebAssembly
- No software installation needed
- No version conflicts possible

---

# FAIR Data Management

## Reproducibility Requires Access

---

## Reproducibility Enables Cumulative Science

**Science is fundamentally cumulative (Merton 1973):**

1. **Verification:** Can we reproduce the finding?
2. **Extension:** Can we build on this work?
3. **Integration:** Can we combine multiple studies?

**Each step requires:**
- Access to materials
- Understanding of methods
- Ability to reuse data and code

---

## The Cost of Non-Reproducibility

**Artner et al. (2021) reproduction study:**
- Attempted to reproduce 232 statistical claims from 46 articles
- Investment: **280 person-days of work**
- Success rate: Only **70%**

**Their conclusion:** *"Vagueness makes assessing reproducibility a nightmare"*

**The problem:** Inadequate documentation and data management

---

## FAIR as Systematic Solution

**FAIR Principles provide structure for:**
- Making research products discoverable
- Ensuring long-term accessibility
- Enabling technical compatibility
- Supporting informed reuse

**Not just "making data available" but making it systematically reusable**

---

## From Reproducible to Reusable

**Reproducible reporting solves one problem:**
- "Can I recreate your results with your data and code?"

**But another problem remains:**
- "Can I actually find and access your data and code?"
- "Can I understand what your data contains?"
- "Can I legally and practically reuse your materials?"

**→ FAIR principles address these questions**

---

## Why FAIR Matters for Reproducibility

**Real examples of reproducibility barriers:**

- Stimulus materials posted but copyright unclear → Cannot reuse
- Data available but no codebook → Cannot understand variables
- Referenced data links broken → Cannot access
- Authors left institution → Cannot locate materials

**Availability alone ≠ Reproducibility**

---

## FAIR Principles

- **F**indable
- **A**ccessible
- **I**nteroperable
- **R**eusable

Framework for systematic practices that enable reuse

---

## FAIR ≠ Open

- FAIR does not necessarily mean "freely accessible"
- Particularly relevant for vulnerable populations
- Metadata remain publicly accessible
- Access path transparently documented

**Principle:** "As open as possible, as closed as necessary"

---

## Empirical Evidence for FAIR

**Health research (Martínez-García et al. 2023):**
- 56.6% time savings in research data management
- Monthly savings: €16,800

**Reproducibility study (Artner et al. 2021):**
- 232 statistical claims from 46 articles
- 280 person-days of work
- Only 70% successfully reproduced

---

## F - Findable

**Components:**

1. Persistent, unique identifiers (DOIs)
2. Rich metadata
3. Indexing in searchable databases

**Repositories:**
- Zenodo.org
- OSF.io
- Research data centers (e.g., Verbund FDB)

---

## A - Accessible

**Gradations:**

- Freely available research products
- Controlled access (private repositories)
- Regulated access via research data centers

**Important:** Transparent documentation of access path

---

## I - Interoperable

**Use of standardized, open formats:**

- Data: CSV with codebook, labeled .Rdata
- Code: R, Python (not MPlus, STATA)
- Avoiding proprietary software

**Alternative open-source software:**
- Jamovi, JASP (instead of SPSS)

---

## R - Reusable

**Comprehensive documentation:**

- Codebooks for each variable
- README files
- Terms of use and licensing information (CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA)
- Research context and framework
- Data quality issues

**Standards:** PSYCH-DS for psychological data

---

## FAIR in Educational Research

**Good examples:**
- National Educational Panel Study (NEPS)
- PISA
- PIRLS

**Challenge:** Scalable approaches for smaller projects with limited resources

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

---

## "Reproducibility sounds time-consuming"

**Answer:**

**Initial investment:** Yes, there's a learning curve

**Long-term benefits:**
- Faster revisions (code is already there)
- Easier collaboration (others can understand your work)
- Better organized workflow
- More citations and trust

**Think incremental:** Start small, improve gradually

---

## "My code is messy and embarrassing"

**Answer:**

**The paradox of open code:**
1. Knowing others will see it → You write better code
2. Better code → Less error-prone, better documented
3. Better documentation → Others can learn from it

**Perfect is the enemy of good:** 
Imperfect but documented code > No code at all

---

## "What about proprietary/sensitive data?"

**Answer:**

**FAIR ≠ Open:**
- Metadata can be public even if data isn't
- Controlled access is still FAIR
- Document access procedures transparently

**For educational research:**
- "As open as possible, as closed as necessary"
- Research data centers provide secure solutions
- Synthetic data for methods illustration

---

## "I'll be scooped!"

**Answer:**

**Your advantages persist:**
- Deep knowledge of your data and design
- First-mover advantage in publication
- Invitations to collaborate on reuse

**Reframing:**
- Reuse = validation of your work
- Citations from secondary analyses
- Broader impact of your research

**Science as common good:** Collective progress benefits everyone

---

## Conclusion

**Reproducibility is not optional—it's core to science:**
- Verification of findings
- Error detection and correction
- Cumulative knowledge building

**Two practical approaches:**

1. **Reproducible Reporting** → Document your complete workflow
2. **FAIR Data Management** → Enable systematic reuse

**Result:** Stronger, more credible, more impactful research

---

## Take-Home Message

**Reproducibility means:**

- Publishing isn't complete without data and code
- Documentation is as important as analysis
- FAIR principles make reuse systematic, not accidental

**Start today:**
- Try literate programming for your next analysis
